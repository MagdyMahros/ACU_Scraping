This has become a vital and effective way to facilitate the flourishing of both the individual within an organisation, and the organisation itself. There is a need to deliberately and consciously develop ""mission literacy"". Any person that has such a developed and conscious 'mission literacy', or is exposed to it, can function in ways that more effectively and efficiently promote human flourishing and dignity – including for themselves. Further, such 'literacy' can result in internal organisational cultures that support high productivity because they are characterised by concepts such as 'harmonious', and 'welcoming' places of belonging and support. The purpose of this course is to support and assist personnel within Catholic and other faith based organisations to acquire the factual and experiential knowledge through readings, reflections and discussions. This supports development in the conceptual and analytical capabilities required to reflect on and to realise personal and organizational mission alignment.",1 year part-time,(pos1#435862#435903:  22-Feb-2021     (pos1#435862,https://courses.acu.edu.au/postgraduate/graduate_certificate_in_mission_and_culture,102811E,"['\n', <strong>Average first year fee</strong>, ':\n    $9064 Fee-Paying \n\n    (indicative only)\n\n']",Domestic students only.,null,(pos1#2358763#2358773:  22-Feb-2021     (pos1#2358763,Domestic students only.,

",Graduate Diploma in High Performance Sport,"The high performance sport industry is a global, multi-billion dollar entity that provides employment opportunities for a range of professions, including sport scientists, coaches and managers. In Australia, there are employment opportunities in professional and semi-professional sporting teams, Australian and state institutes of sport, academies of sport, and other sporting organisations. These opportunities extend to the international market. At the heart of this industry is the conditioning of the athlete, with the aim of optimising individual and team performance for successful outcomes. A professional working in this industry needs to know about testing protocols to assess athlete performance, principles of strength and conditioning, and the technologies available for monitoring and training the high performance athlete. They will need to understand the relationships between fatigue, adaptation, performance and injury, how to acquire meaningful performance data, and how to work within the culture of a high performance industry. The application of this knowledge and understanding to the planning and delivery of meaningful interventions for athletes to enhance performance and reduce the likelihood (and/or duration) of injury and illness, using appropriate techniques of analysis to accurately interpret competition and training information, and using advanced information literacy skills to communicate ideas and outcomes to specialist and non-specialist audiences is essential for a professional working in the high performance sport environment. Professionals in this area also need to be equipped with problem solving and self-management skills that promote independent learning and thinking and for pursuing further learning if they are to maintain relevance in an industry that is, by definition, fiercely competitive and constantly evolving.

Deferment ,Melbourne  North Sydney,1.5 years full-time or equivalent part-time.,,Master of Business Administration,"A pinnacle business qualification for individuals that believe in more than just maximising profits. The corporate landscape is shifting; companies focused exclusively on maximising shareholder wealth are being challenged to consider their broader social and community obligations and how they are contributing to the common good. To what extent should corporations be ethically or values-driven rather than shareholder focused? At ACU we believe this is a false dichotomy – and an illusory trade-off. Emerging evidence suggests that serving the social good is a winning model for driving sustainable long-term profit growth and value creation. Our Executive Master of Business Admiration (MBAE) challenges participants to consider how contemporary business models can embrace ethical values and sustainable profit growth, and how these two apparently competing ambitions are, in fact, intertwined and interdependent. The MBAE is robust by design. We aim to challenge you, to engage you in lively debate, to give you skills that enable you to think critically, differently and outside of the standard, to tackle the big questions, and create bigger results with true mutual value and benefit. It is a refreshing interdisciplinary learning journey, drawing from the fields of psychology, sociology, humanities, business, economics, accounting, finance, education, and philosophy, and focusing on the core elements of business.

",Master of High Performance Sport,"The high performance sport industry is a global, multi-billion dollar entity that provides employment opportunities for a vast range of professions. In Australia, there are employment opportunities in professional and semi-professional sport, Australian and state institutes of sport and academies of sport, and other sporting organisations, and these opportunities extend to the international market. At the heart of high performance sport is the conditioning of the athlete, with the aim of optimising individual and team performance for successful outcomes. A professional working in this industry needs to know about testing protocols to assess athlete performance, principles of strength and conditioning, and the technologies available for monitoring and training the high performance athlete. They will need to understand the relationships between fatigue, adaptation, performance and injury, how to acquire meaningful performance data, and how to work within the culture of a high performance industry. The application of this knowledge and understanding to the planning and delivery of meaningful interventions for athletes to enhance performance and reduce the likelihood (and/or duration) of injury and illness, using appropriate techniques of analysis to accurately interpret competition and training information, and using advanced information literacy skills to communicate ideas and outcomes to specialist and non-specialist audiences is essential for a professional working in the high performance sport environment. Professionals in this area also need to be equipped with problem solving and self-management skills that promote independent learning and thinking and for pursuing further learning if they are to maintain relevance in an industry that is, by definition, fiercely competitive and constantly evolving. This course is designed to suit a postgraduate clientele that is already in the workforce, as well as graduating students. The course provides flexible learning pathways that can accommodate: To meet these objectives, the primary design feature is that the majority of the course is delivered in the online mode.

Multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary foci built into the curriculum will bring together current and new knowledge from allied health professions within the industry, for example, sports psychology, skill acquisition, nutrition and dietetics, exercise physiology, physiotherapy, sports medicine and rehabilitation, including a specialist seminar series of guest speakers from sports science and related fields. Issues of leadership, culture, and communication in high performance sport setting area addressed, and a foundation of project design and research skills is incorporated into the program with direct application to high performance sporting contexts.
