COURSE FORMAT, STUDY MODE AND COURSE DURATIONCourse participants will be given classroom tutorials, as well as group and individual activities to develop their skills and confidence in any areas identified during their initial gap assessment at the time of enrolment.The (full) course duration is scheduled to run for five (7 hour) days per week over a 3-5 weeks period, depending on the intake.

The main aim of this program is to deliver only the units of competency needed by the student to increase their likelihood of successfully completing a Certificate 3 level vocational program and therefore, while some students may be awarded a full qualification, it is not the primary aim of studying these foundation subjects.    SUPPORT SERVICESYour program will be delivered by a team of specialist Trainers who will remain accessible to you for support beyond this training program.The 1 Education administration team will also remain available to assist you with any non-educational issues not relating specifically to your course content, or in cases where an issue cannot be resolved between you and your Trainer.Please remember that a detailed step-by-step guide for raising complaints and appealing an assessment decision, has been provided in the 1 Education Student Handbook, made available to you via the 1 Education website.    LANGUAGE LITERACY AND NUMERACYParticipants in this program would have completed an Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF) assessment prior to their enrolment to identify areas where the student might benefit from further development prior to commencing their Certificate 3 level program.This process will involve a written activity, followed by an informal conversation or interview with your Assessor.
